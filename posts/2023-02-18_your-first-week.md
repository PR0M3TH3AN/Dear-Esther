## Your Birthday

Thursday morning, February 9th 2023, your Mom and I woke up around 11 am after an unusualy good nights rest. Jess was visibly nervious about the days ahead but she had a very good pregancy overall, even dispite her gestational diabeties. 

The nights leading up to your induction date she had experienced these tremmors almost like she was in shock for a few hours in the early morning. They would last for an hour or so and then subside. We went to our favorite brunch place down the street from our house on Glasgow Road called First Watch.
