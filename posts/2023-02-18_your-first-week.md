## The Day Before Your Birthday

Thursday morning, February 9th 2023, your Mom and I woke up around 11 am after an unusually good nights rest. Jess was visibly nervous about the days ahead but she had a very good pregnancy overall and we knew the Lord would bless us with a good birth as well, even despite her gestational diabetes. 

The nights leading up to your induction date she had experienced tremors almost like she was in shock for a few hours in the early morning. They would last for an hour or so and then subside but then repeat again the next night around the same time.

Thursday morning we went to our favorite brunch place down the street from our house on Glasgow Road called First Watch. We talked about you and what we were heading into. We had great peace.

## Getting to The Hospital

The Fort Sanders Hospital was going to call us in the afternoon to let us know when to come in and start the induction process. It was quite in the house waiting for the call that finally did come around 3pm.
