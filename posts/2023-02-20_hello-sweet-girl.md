## Hello sweet girl

To My Dearest Little Baby Esther,

It is so surreal that I have reached this moment in my life. Febuary 10th 2023, is the day I became your mommy. It truly is the best day of my life. Nothing can prepare you for the moment you meet your baby, but boy oh boy your daddy and I are smitten with you. We never knew the deep joy, happiness, and emotion we would have when you came into this world at 6:01am. You weighed 8lbs 5oz and was 21 inches long. 

I'll never forget the overwhelming wave of emotion as I made my last push for you to come into the world. I just kept thinking I couldnt wait to meet my baby girl. You were my motivation. I cried so hard and just gabe God all the glory for keeping you safe and giving you to us. He truly is a great God!

Your daddy held my hand throuh every part of labor and delivery and wouldnt leave my side for anything. I remember opening my eyes between contractions and watching him glued to the monitors for 13 hours. We were concerned about your heart rate, since it dropped very low one time and a flood of nurses entered the room. All became steady again and I just had peace that God was with me and taking care of us. I knew God was already there in that day and time and He was going to take care of us. 

There was another person who God prepared for that time. She was my cheerleader, encourager, and your diligent care taker.  She was a true God-sent traveling nurse named Pam, but I'll write about her in a later post.

I can reflect back on the scariest and most joyous time of my life and truly see the hand of God at work. I adored my labor and delivery. I knew that each contraction would lead me to you. The staff were incredible and took very good care of me and you. The epidural was amazing and allowed me to make precious memories with your daddy along the way. I could not have done it without him. He is my rock and better half. Your are truly blessed to call him daddy. 

I am sitting here on the couch watching you wiggle and kick next to me and I cant help but think about how much I love you. 

I am so thankful for your daddy setting up this blog to write to you. I look forward to sharing my thoughts, love, and adoration for you.
